# React Native By Example
This is the code repository for [React Native By Example](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/react-native-example?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786464750), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
React Native with its ability to build native apps using JavaScript is gaining massive popularity in the world of application development. Developers now have the luxury to write world-class mobile applications that look and work as native with the comfort of a language that is already widely used.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
class Tasks extends Component { 
  render () { 
    return ( 
      <View style = {{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center',  
        alignItems: 'center', backgroundColor: '#F5FCFF'  
      }}> 
        <Text style = {{ fontSize: 20, textAlign:  
          'center', margin: 10 }}> 
          Welcome to React Native! 
        </Text> 
      </View> 
    ) 
  } 
}
```

Hardware-wise, you will need a Mac for this book. The content in this book is iOS-first, and to develop iOS apps you must have an Apple computer. Optionally, both an iOS and Android device would be helpful for testing apps on-device, but not mandatory. There is one API in the final chapter of the book that requires a physical device to test (Vibration), and another where testing would be easier on a physical device (Linking).

You will need to install the React Native SDK for your Mac. Instructions can be found at https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html. Prerequisites for installing the React Native SDK are available on that page.

Instructions to install Xcode and Android Studio are also available on that same page for installing the React Native SDK to your machine.
